# opencode-beads

[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issue tracker integration for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is intentionally small in scope. The [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) project is moving quickly and is a moving target — any additional layers on top of it add churn.
>
> To minimize maintenance, this plugin defers to beads and limits its scope to bug fixes and syncing upstream vendor plugin content. Feature requests and additional customization are generally out of scope.
>
> If you want to customize behavior, the plugin surface area is small — forking or copying it locally is encouraged.

## Installation

Install the beads CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

See the [beads installation guide](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads/blob/main/docs/INSTALLING.md) for alternative methods (Homebrew, Windows, AUR, etc.).

Add to your OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-beads"]
}
```

Restart OpenCode and you're ready to go.

Optionally, pin to a specific version for stability:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-beads@0.6.0"]
}
```

OpenCode fetches unpinned plugins from npm on each startup; pinned versions are cached and require a manual version bump to update.

## Features

- **Context injection** - Automatically runs `bd prime` on session start and after compaction, keeping your agent aware of current issues
- **Commands** - All beads operations available as `/bd-*` commands
- **Task agent** - Autonomous issue completion via `beads-task-agent` subagent

## Usage

This plugin brings beads into OpenCode. For learning how to use beads itself - workflows, commands, best practices - see the [beads documentation](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads).

The plugin automatically injects beads context on session start and after compaction, so your agent stays oriented.

## Commands

Commands are available as `/bd-*` and mirror the `bd` CLI. See the [beads documentation](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for the full command reference.

## Agent

### beads-task-agent

A subagent for autonomous issue completion. Designed to work through issues independently, updating status and handling dependencies.
